## Holiday-adjacent Daily Coding Challenge 2023

Going to try it in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) I guess. Don't judge me too harshly, I haven't used this language much.

Might also try some in rust once Haskell starts feeling intuitive.


## Usage

#### Haskell 

Use [VS Code Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell) for a surprisingly quick & easy Haskell dev environment setup.

### Running the Code

I can assure you this is approximately correct, or was a couple commits ago.

#### Day 1

```
# compile 
ghc src/day1.hs
  .....success message

# pipe input data to executable 
cat input/input.txt | ./src/day1
```
